# GRIP
THIS IS MY FIRST JOURNEY
This project is a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP internship focusing time series analysis of historical stock prices and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
The historical stock prices dataset has been extracted from https://finance.yahoo.com/ 
The news headlines data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6.
I have used Auto-ARIMA model to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. In the sentiment analysis model, 
I have made use of different machine learning algorithms-Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM, Adaboost and Xgboost- to make the predictions.
